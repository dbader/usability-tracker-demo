======================

Accompanying demo code to our paper "Towards Automated Detection of Mobile Usability Issues" as presented at ME'2013. The interesting parts can be found in [UsabilityTracker.m](https://github.com/dbader/usability-tracker-demo/blob/master/DBDemoApp/UsabilityTracker/UsabilityTracker.m) and in the `viewDidAppear` methods of the view controllers.

## Usage
- Compile, install, and launch the application
- Rapidly switch several times between both tabs in the app
- After several switches an alert opens, indicating that the heuristic was triggered
